    """
    Get geometric properties of objects including bounding box, area, volume, and centroid.

    Supports both single object and batch operations. Use `object_id` for a single object
    or `object_ids` for multiple objects.

    Parameters:
        object_id: GUID of a single object to query
        object_ids: List of GUIDs for batch operations

    Returns:
        For single object: Properties dict with bounding_box, area, volume, centroid, surface_area
        For batch: List of property dicts, one per object

    Properties returned:
        - bounding_box: { min: [x,y,z], max: [x,y,z], dimensions: [w,h,d] }
        - area: Surface area for surfaces/breps, None for curves/points
        - volume: Volume for closed solids, None for open geometry
        - centroid: Center of mass [x,y,z]
        - surface_area: Surface area for breps
        - is_solid: Whether the object is a closed solid
        - curve_length: Length for curves, None otherwise

    Example:
        get_object_properties(object_id="abc-123-...")
        get_object_properties(object_ids=["id1", "id2", "id3"])
